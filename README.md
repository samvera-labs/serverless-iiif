## Description

A [IIIF 2.1 Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) compliant server written as an [AWS Serverless Application](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).

## Components

* A simple [Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) wrapper for the [iiif-processor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iiif-processor) module.
* A [Lambda Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) containing all the dependencies for the Lambda Function.
* An [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) interface for the Lambda Function.
* A [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template describing the resources needed to deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

* Some basic knowledge of AWS.
* An Amazon Web Services account with permissions to create resources via the console and/or command line.
* An [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket to hold the source images to be served via IIIF.
  **Note: The Lambda Function will be granted read access to this bucket.**

## Quick Start

`serverless-iiif` is distributed and deployed via the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). To deploy it using the AWS Console:

1. Click to ðŸ‘‰ [Deploy the Serverless Application](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:625046682746:applications/serverless-iiif) ðŸ‘ˆ from the AWS Console.
2. Make sure your currently selected region (in the console's top navigation bar) is the one you want to deploy to.
3. Scroll down to the **Application settings** section.
4. Give your stack a unique name, enter the name of the image bucket, and check the box acknowledging that the
   app will create an IAM execution role for itself.
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. When all the resources are properly created and configured, the new stack should be in the **CREATE_COMPLETE** stage. If there's an error, it will delete all the resources it created, roll back any changes it made, and eventually reach the **ROLLBACK_COMPLETE** stage.
7. Click the **CloudFormation stack** link.
8. Click the **Outputs** tab to see (and copy) the IIIF Endpoint URL.

## Source Images

The S3 key of any given file, minus the extension, is its IIIF ID. For example, if you want to access the image manifest for the file at `abcdef.tif`, you would get `https://.../iiif/2/abcdef/info.json`. If your key contains slashes, they must be URL-encoded: e.g., `ab/cd/ef/gh.tif` would be at `https://.../iiif/2/ab%2Fcd%2Fef%2Fgh/info.json`. (This limitation could easily be fixed by encoding only the necessary slashes in the incoming URL before handing it off to the IIIF processor, but that's beyond the scope of the demo.)

`iiif-processor` can use any image format _natively_ supported by [libvips](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/), but best results will come from using tiled, multi-resolution TIFFs. The Lambda Function wrapper included in this application assumes a `.tif` extension.

### Creating tiled TIFFs

#### Using VIPS

    vips tiffsave source_image.tif output_image.tif --tile --pyramid --compression jpeg --tile-width 256 --tile-height 256

#### Using ImageMagick

    convert source_image.tif -define tiff:tile-geometry=256x256 -compress jpeg 'ptif:output_image.tif'

## Testing

If tests are run locally they will start in "watch" mode. If a CI environment is detected they will only run once. From the project root run:

```
npm test
```

To generate a code coverage report run:

```
npm test --coverage
```

## Advanced Usage

The SAM deploy template takes an optional `PreflightFunctionARN` parameter. This parameter, if provided, refers to a [CloudFront Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-functions.html) (*not* a standard Lambda) that will be associated with the CloudFront distribution at the `viewer-request` stage. This function can perform authentication and authorization functions, or it can change how the S3 file and/or image dimensions are resolved.

### Examples

#### Simple Authorization

```JavaScript
function handler(event) {
    if (notAuthorized) { // based on something in the event.request
       return {
         statusCode: 403,
         statusDescription: 'Unauthorized'
       };
    };
    return event.request;
}
```

#### Custom File Location / Image Dimensions

```JavaScript
function handler(event) {
  const request = event.request;
  request.headers['x-preflight-location'] = 's3://image-bucket/path/to/correct/image.tif'
  request.headers['x-preflight-dimensions'] = JSON.stringify({ width: 640, height: 480 });
  return request;
}
```

*Note:* The SAM deploy template adds a `preflight=true` environment variable to the main IIIF Lambda if a preflight function is provided. The function will _only_ look for the preflight headers if this environment variable is `true`. This prevents requests from including those headers directly if no preflight function is present. If you do use a preflight function, make sure it strips out any `x-preflight-location` and `x-preflight-dimensions` headers that it doesn't set itself.

## Notes

AWS API Gateway Lambda integration has a payload (request/response body) size limit of approximately 6MB in both directions. To overcome this limitation, the API is configured behind an AWS CloudFront distribution with two origins â€“Â the API and a cache bucket. Responses larger than 6MB are saved to the cache bucket at the same relative path as the request, and the API returns a `404 Not Found` response to CloudFront. CloudFront then fails over to the second origin (the cache bucket), where it finds the actual response and returns it.

The cache bucket uses an S3 lifecycle rule to expire cached responses in 1 day.
