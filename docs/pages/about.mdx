# About

## IIIF in the Cloud

- Access is bursty by nature
- Tile requests are at least an order of magnitude burstier
- Very hard to scale a server-based solution in a way that can handle the bursts without wasting capacity (and money)

## Under the Hood

### libvips

“A demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing library”

- Very fast and extremely lightweight
- Can perform more than 300 different image manipulation operations
- Supports a large number of image formats
- Most importantly (for our purposes), it supports multi-resolution images
  and tiling
- [Documentation ↗](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/)

### sharp
