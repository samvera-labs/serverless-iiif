# Notes

Lambda Function URLs have a payload (request/response body) size limit of approximately 6MB in both directions. To overcome this limitation, the Lambda URL is configured behind an AWS CloudFront distribution with two origins - the API and a cache bucket. Responses larger than 6MB are saved to the cache bucket at the same relative path as the request, and the Lambda returns a `404 Not Found` response to CloudFront. CloudFront then fails over to the second origin (the cache bucket), where it finds the actual response and returns it.

The cache bucket uses an S3 lifecycle rule to expire cached responses in 1 day.
