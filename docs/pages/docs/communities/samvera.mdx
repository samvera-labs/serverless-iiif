The Samvera Community is a global community of technologists who create and maintain repository software. Institutions around the world rely on Samvera Community supported software to provide access to their digital content.

Samvera is also a community of practice where software developers and library technologists can support and learn from one another. We have active participation from metadata specialists, repository managers, user experience professionals, and others who contribute their expertise to ensure the software stays relevant and responsive to changing needs.
