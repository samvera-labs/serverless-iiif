# Custom Sharp Layer

This lambda uses the Sharp layer from https://github.com/samvera/lambda-layer-sharp-jp2/releases in order to get a version of Sharp with jp2 support.

You can build your own local version using that code and then copy the file to `serverless-iiif/sharp-lambda-layer.x86_64.zip`. Then set `LOCAL_SHARP=true` and `build/deploy` to use your own version.
