## Description

A [IIIF 2.1 Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) compliant server written as an [AWS Serverless Application](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).

## Components

- A simple [Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) wrapper for the [iiif-processor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iiif-processor) module.
- A [Lambda Function URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) that is used to invoke the IIIF API via HTTPS.
- A [Lambda Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) containing all the dependencies for the Lambda Function.
- An optional [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template describing the resources needed to deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

- Some basic knowledge of AWS.
- An Amazon Web Services account with permissions to create resources via the console and/or command line.
- An [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket to hold the source images to be served via IIIF.

<Callout>
  Note: The Lambda Function will be granted read access to this bucket.
