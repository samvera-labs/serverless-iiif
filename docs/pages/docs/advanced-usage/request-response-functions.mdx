# Request/Response Functions

The SAM deploy template takes several optional parameters to enable the association of [CloudFront Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-functions.html) or [Lambda@Edge Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html) with the CloudFront distribution. These functions can perform authentication and authorization functions, change how the S3 file and/or image dimensions are resolved, or alter the response from the lambda or cache. These parameters are:

- `OriginRequestARN`: ARN of the Lambda@Edge Function to use at the origin-request stage
- `OriginResponseARN`: ARN of the Lambda@Edge Function to use at the origin-response stage
- `ViewerRequestARN`: ARN of the CloudFront or Lambda@Edge Function to use at the viewer-request stage
- `ViewerRequestType`: Type of viewer-request Function to use (`CloudWatch Function` or `Lambda@Edge`)
- `ViewerResponseARN`: ARN of the CloudFront or Lambda@Edge Function to use at the viewer-response stage
- `ViewerResponseType`: Type of viewer-response Function to use (`CloudWatch Function` or `Lambda@Edge`)

These functions, if used, must be created, configured, and published before the serverless application is deployed.

## Examples

These examples use CloudFront Functions. Lambda@Edge functions are slightly more complicated in terms of the event structure but the basic idea is the same.

### Simple Authorization

```javascript
function handler(event) {
  if (notAuthorized) {
    // based on something in the event.request
    return {
      statusCode: 403,
      statusDescription: 'Unauthorized'
    };
  }
  return event.request;
}
```

### Custom File Location / Image Dimensions

```javascript
function handler(event) {
  var request = event.request;
  request.headers['x-preflight-location'] = {
    value: 's3://image-bucket/path/to/correct/image.tif'
  };
  request.headers['x-preflight-dimensions'] = {
    value: JSON.stringify({ width: 640, height: 480 })
  };
  return request;
}
```

The `x-preflight-dimensions` header can take several shapes:

- `{ width, height }` (or `[{ width, height }]`) - a straightforward, single-resolution image
- `[{ width, height }, { width, height }, ...]` - a multi-resolution image with pages of the specified sizes
- `{ width, height, pages }` - a multi-resolution image with the specified number of `pages`, each half the size of the one before
- `{ width, height, limit }` - a multi-resolution image in which the smallest width and height are both less than the specified `limit`

For example, the following dimension values would all describe the same pyramidal image:

- `[{ width: 2048, height: 1536 }, { width: 1024, height: 768 }, { width: 512, height: 384 }]`
- `{ width: 2048, height: 1536, pages: 3 }`
- `{ width: 2048, height: 1536, limit: 480 }`

The `limit` calculator will keep going until both dimensions are _less than_ the limit, not _less than or equal to_. So a `limit: 512` on the third example above would generate a fourth page at `{ width: 256, height: 192 }`.

<Callout>
  The SAM deploy template adds a `preflight=true` environment variable to the
  main IIIF Lambda if a preflight function is provided. The function will _only_
  look for the preflight headers if this environment variable is `true`. This
  prevents requests from including those headers directly if no preflight
  function is present.

If you do use a preflight function, make sure it strips
out any `x-preflight-location` and `x-preflight-dimensions` headers that it
doesn't set itself.
