### Request/Response Functions

The IIIF service can be heavily customized through the use of [CloudFront Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-functions.html) or [Lambda@Edge Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html) attached to a CloudFront distribution in front of the service. It's important to understand the four stages of CloudFront processing in order to know where a given type of customization belongs.

- A `viewer-request` function will be called on every request, cached or not. This is the appropriate place to attach 
  a function that performs authorization, authentication, or anything else whose result should *not* be cached.
- An `origin-request` function will only be called when CloudFront refreshes the content from the origin (e.g., the IIIF server).
  It's the appropriate place to attach a function that *should* be cached, such as S3 file resolution or the retrieval of
  image dimensions.
- Similarly, the `origin-response` and `viewer-response` functions are called after the IIIF server returns its response
  and before CloudFront passes it on to the viewer, respectively. They can be used to alter the response in a way that is
  either cached or ephemeral.

#### Examples

These examples use CloudFront Functions. Lambda@Edge functions are slightly more complicated in terms of the event structure but the basic idea is the same.

##### Simple Authorization

```JavaScript
function handler(event) {
    if (notAuthorized) { // based on something in the event.request
       return {
         statusCode: 403,
         statusDescription: 'Unauthorized'
       };
    };
    return event.request;
}
```

##### Custom File Location / Image Dimensions

```JavaScript
function handler(event) {
  var request = event.request;
  request.headers['x-preflight-location'] = {value: 's3://image-bucket/path/to/correct/image.tif'};
  request.headers['x-preflight-dimensions'] = {value: JSON.stringify({ width: 640, height: 480 })};
  return request;
}
```

The `x-preflight-dimensions` header can take several shapes:

* `{ width, height }` (or `[{ width, height }]`) - a straightforward, single-resolution image
* `[{ width, height }, { width, height }, ...]` - a multi-resolution image with pages of the specified sizes
* `{ width, height, pages }` - a multi-resolution image with the specified number of `pages`, each half the size of the one before
* `{ width, height, limit }` - a multi-resolution image in which the smallest width and height are both less than the specified `limit`

For example, the following dimension values would all describe the same pyramidal image:

* `[{ width: 2048, height: 1536 }, { width: 1024, height: 768 }, { width: 512, height: 384 }]`
* `{ width: 2048, height: 1536, pages: 3 }`
* `{ width: 2048, height: 1536, limit: 480 }`

The `limit` calculator will keep going until both dimensions are _less than_ the limit, not _less than or equal to_. So a `limit: 512` on the third example above would generate a fourth page at `{ width: 256, height: 192 }`.

<Callout>
If you plan to use CloudFront functions to add either of the above `x-preflight-` headers to incoming requests, you *must* set the value of the `Preflight` parameter to `true` when deploying `serverless-iiif`. The function will _only_ look for the preflight headers if this environment variable is `true`. This prevents requests from including those headers directly if no preflight function is present. If you do use a preflight function, make sure it strips out any `x-preflight-location` and `x-preflight-dimensions` headers that it doesn't set itself.
