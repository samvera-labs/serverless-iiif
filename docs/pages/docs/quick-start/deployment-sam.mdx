# Deploying via the AWS Serverless Application Repository

`serverless-iiif` is distributed and deployed via the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). To deploy it using the AWS Console:

<Steps>

### Step 1

Find the [serverless-iiif application](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:625046682746:applications/serverless-iiif) in the AWS Serverless Application Repository.

### Step 2

Make sure your currently selected region (in the console's top navigation bar) is the one you want to deploy to.

### Step 3

Scroll down to the **Application settings** section.

### Step 4

Configure the deploy template:

- Give your stack a unique **Application name**
- Enter the name of the **SourceBucket** the service will serve images from
- Check the box acknowledging that the app will create a custom IAM roles and resource policies (and if deploying the Caching version, that it will also deploy a nested application)
- _Optional_: Enter or change any other parameters that apply to your desired configuration.

### Step 5

Click **Deploy**.

### Step 6

When all the resources are properly created and configured, the new stack should be in the **CREATE_COMPLETE** stage. If there's an error, it will delete all the resources it created, roll back any changes it made, and eventually reach the **ROLLBACK_COMPLETE** stage.

### Step 7

Click the **CloudFormation stack** link.

### Step 8

Click the **Outputs** tab to see (and copy) the IIIF Endpoint URL.
