`serverless-iiif` is deployed as a Lambda Function URL, in the `lambda-url.AWS_REGION.on.aws` domain (e.g., `https://fu90293j0pj902j902c32j902.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/iiif/2/`). In order to use a custom domain name, or other features like caching and pre/post-processing functions, you'll have to set up a [CloudFront distribution](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
