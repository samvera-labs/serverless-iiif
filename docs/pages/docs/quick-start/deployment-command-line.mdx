# Deploying via the Command Line

<Steps>

### Step 1

Make sure you have the [SAM CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed.

### Step 2

Make sure the AWS CLI is [properly configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with credentials that have sufficient access to manage IAM, S3, Lambda, and (optionally) CloudFront resources.

### Step 3

Clone this repository.

### Step 4

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Update the various values within.

### Step 5

Build the application:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

### Step 6

Deploy the application:

```shell
$ npm run deploy
```

You'll be prompted for various configuration parameters, confirmations, and acknowledgments of specific issues (particularly the creation of IAM resources and the deployment of an open/unauthenticated Lambda Function URL).

### Step 7

Follow the prompts to complete the deployment process and get the resulting endpoint.
