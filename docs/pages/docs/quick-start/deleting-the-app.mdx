# Deleting the application

The easiest way to delete the application is either from the [Lambda Applications Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/applications) or by deleting its [CloudFormation Stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks?filteringStatus=active&filteringText=&viewNested=true&hideStacks=false).

If you deployed from the command line, you can also use the `npm run delete` command.
